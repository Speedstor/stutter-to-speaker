# stutter-to-speaker

I often pause in the middle of sentences, finding the right words. I often 
go blank in responses. And what I say is hard to follow. I need to fix all
these problems. So, I'll document my attempts to solve this, evaluating
the effectiveness of each by grading my talking-heads videos and daily 
converations.

### Attempt 1
*blindly speaking more will just solidify my bad habits, I need better vocabulary/literacy foundation*
- crossword puzzles
- film myself speaking `(try talking about different things, organize the attempts later)`

<br/>

### Potential Exercises
1. Read and write about a **non-engineering** book every week: *It might be faster to improve reading rate solely by increasing "vocabulary"/literacy, than to just struggle through reading research papers, not finish any one of them*
2. Compile complete pieces. Finish blog posts, proof-read essays. Release software and study-guides to myself.
3. have a coherent coding stream on Youtube Live
4. Write about what I consume. Write a paragraph, record a response to every content I read.
