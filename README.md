# stutter-to-speaker

I often pause in the middle of sentences, finding the right words. I often 
go blank in responses. And what I say is hard to follow. I need to fix all
these problems. So, I'll document my attempts to solve this, evaluating
the effectiveness of each by grading my talking-heads videos and daily 
converations.

### Attempt 1
*blindly speaking more will just solidify my bad habits, I need better vocabulary foundation*
- crossword puzzles

### Potential Exercises
1. Read and write about a non-engineering book every week: *It might be faster to improve reading rate solely by increasing "vocabulary"/literacy, than to just struggle through reading research papers, not finish any one of them"
